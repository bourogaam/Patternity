/**
 * Marks an instance as following the composite pattern that describes that a
 * group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an
 * object.
 * 
 * The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to
 * represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets
 * clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
